    "We have a horizon $t = 2$ at which the bank's return on the risky investments are collected, the deposits are repaid, and the stockholders of the bank get any remaining funds. The returns of the bank's investment are given by the value of a Gaussian R.V. $R ~ N(\\overline{R}, \\sigma_R^2)$, which is realized at time $t = 2$. \n",
